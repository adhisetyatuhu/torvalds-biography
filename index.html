                <h2 class="">Early Life</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland, on 28 December 1969, the son of journalists Anna and Nils Torvalds, the grandson of statistician Leo Törnqvist and of poet Ole Torvalds, and the great-grandson of journalist and soldier Toivo Karanko. His parents were campus radicals at the University of Helsinki in the 1960s. His family belongs to the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland. He was named after Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize–winning American chemist, although in the book Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source Revolution, he is quoted as saying, "I think I was named equally for Linus the Peanuts cartoon character", noting that this made him "half Nobel Prize–winning chemist and half blanket-carrying cartoon character".</p>
                    <p>His interest in computers began with a VIC-20 at the age of 11 in 1981. He started programming for it in BASIC, then later by directly accessing the 6502 CPU in machine code (he did not utilize assembly language). He then purchased a Sinclair QL, which he modified extensively, especially its operating system. "Because it was so hard to get software for it in Finland", he wrote his own assembler and editor "(in addition to Pac-Man graphics libraries)" for the QL, and a few games. He wrote a Pac-Man clone, Cool Man.</p>
                    <p>Torvalds attended the University of Helsinki from 1988 to 1996, graduating with a master's degree in computer science from the NODES research group. His textbooks while there included Programming the 80386 by John H. Crawford and Patrick P. Gelsinger, SYBEX, 1987 ISBN 0895883813, and The Design of the UNIX Operating System by Maurice J. Bach, Prentice-Hall, 1986 ISBN 0-13-201799-7.</p>
                    <p>He bought computer science professor Andrew Tanenbaum's book Operating Systems: Design and Implementation, in which Tanenbaum describes MINIX, an educational stripped-down version of Unix. In 1990, Torvalds resumed his university studies, and was exposed to Unix for the first time in the form of a DEC MicroVAX running ULTRIX. His MSc thesis was titled Linux: A Portable Operating System.</p>
                    <p>On 5 January 1991 he purchased an Intel 80386-based IBM PC clone before receiving his MINIX copy, which in turn enabled him to begin work on Linux.</p>
                    <p>His academic career was interrupted after his first year of study when he joined the Finnish Navy Nyland Brigade in the summer of 1989, selecting the 11-month officer training program to fulfill the mandatory military service of Finland. He gained the rank of second lieutenant, with the role of an artillery observer.</p>

                <h2>Achievements</h2>
                <section>
                    <h3 class="text-black">Software</h3>
                    <p>Linus Torvalds bears a lot of the hallmarks of successful technology entrepreneurs – a visionary with immense passion for his product. He is without doubt one of the most influential innovators within the history of the software industry. Some of his innovation in software industry are Linux, Git, and Subsurface.</p>
                    <div class="container-content bg-orange">
                        <h3>Linux</h3>
                        <p>In 1991, Torvalds decided that his new MS-DOS-driven PC needed an alternative operating system. He had enough programming know-how under his belt to assume that he could achieve this himself. His goal was to create a UNIX-like operating system he could use at home. Using the Marice J. Bach book “Design of the Unix Operating System” as a guide, he set out to create the system, working long, hard hours until, at age 22, he completed a rough version. He called his system “Linux,” a combination of UNIX and his name, and posted the source code free on the Internet.</p>
    
                        <p>Torvalds’ philosophy was that if he made the software available for free downloading, including the source code, anyone with knowledge of and interest in computer programming could modify the system and ultimately make it better, and/or modify it for their own specific purposes.  Linux quickly gained popularity among hard-core computer users. Licensed under a GNU General Public License, the system is available free to anyone who can get, use, modify, distribute and copy it. By 1999, an estimated seven million computers were running on Linux.</p>

                    <div class="container-content bg-orange mt-1">
                        <h3>Git</h3>
                        <p>On 3 April 2005, Torvalds began development on Git, version control software that later became widely used. On 26 July 2005, he turned over Git's maintenance to Junio Hamano, a major project contributor.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="container-content bg-orange mt-1">
                        <h3>Subsurface</h3>
                        <p>In fall of 2011, when a forced lull in kernel development gave him a chance to start a new project, Linux creator Linus Torvalds decided to tackle his frustration with the lack of decent divelog software on Linux.</p>
                        <p>Subsurface can plan and track single- and multi-tank dives using air, Nitrox or TriMix. It allows tracking of dive locations including GPS coordinates (which can also conveniently be entered using a map interface), logging of equipment used and names of other divers, and lets users rate dives and provide additional notes.</p>
                        <p>You can tag dives and filter a dive list based on criteria including tags, locations and people with whom you were diving. You can group the dive list into trips, and edit multiple dives at the same time, making it easy to support a large number of dives.</p>

                <p>Linus Torvalds once said on businessinsider.com, "<em>I absolutely detest modern 'social media' — Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. It's a disease.
